<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Extracted from our data sources to build a base for each Machine Learning model.
Obtain the most important variables from the Combine/ Proday events.
User Machine Learning to predict if a QB would start in the NFL 
Obtained the ten most popular songs from each year and loaded them into a mongoDB. We used our Javascript development skills to upload our datasets. We used this to showcase each visualization on our webpage!

## Who can use this data

This project can be used to find out which variables from the Combine and ProDay are the most important. Could our model that would predict which Quarterbacks would be drafted and/or start on an NFL team based on Combine/ProDay Results.


## Prerequisites:
* Visualization must include a Python Flaskâ€“powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
